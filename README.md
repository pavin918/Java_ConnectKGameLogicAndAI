I only take credit for creating my AI. The game logic was provided by the TAs of UCI's Fall 2016 AI course, CS 171.

In order to properly demonstrate my AI, I have included the files for the game. My AI is in the "ConnectKAI" folder.

Directions to play the game.

1. To play the ConnectK game, go into the "ConnectK-FQ2016_STABLE" folder.

2. Then, double-click "ConnectK_1.8.jar"

3. To play against an AI, to pit 2 AIs against each other, to change the dimensions of the board, or to apply gravity, like in a real Connect 4 game, start a new game.

	3.1. To start a new game, click "File" in the top-left corner and then click "New".

	3.2. To select an AI, click the "Add AI" button. To select the AI I worked on:
		
		3.2.1. To the immediate right of the "Look In" dropdown menu, click on the "Up One Level" button (the button with a picture of a folder and an upward-pointing arrow).

		3.2.2. Double-click on the "ConnectKAI" folder.

		3.2.3. Double-click on the "JavaAI" folder.

		3.2.4. Double-click on the "bin" folder.

		3.2.5. Double-click on the "PaupersAI.class" file.

	3.3. Back at the "New Game" window, click on either the "Player 1 AI" radio button or the "Player 2 AI" radio button to have the AI be Player 1 or Player 2, respectively.

4. To change the dimensions of the board, click the up or down arrows that are at the right of the "Width" text box and "Height" text box. Alternatively, move the cursor over the "Width" text box or "Height" text box, erase the number, and enter a positive number.

5. To change how many pieces in a row it will take to win, click the up or down arrows that are at the right of the "K" text box. Alternatively, move the cursor over the "K" text box, erase the number, and enter a positive number that is smaller than the smallest dimension of the board.

6. To play with or without gravity, click the up or down arrows that are at the right of the "Gravity" text box.

7. Click the "New Game" button to start the game.

8. Click the "Cancel" button or the "X" button at the top right corner of the window to resume the current game.

9. To close the game, click the "X" at the top-right corner of the "ConnectK" window.
